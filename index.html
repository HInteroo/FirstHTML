	<section id = "Why">
		<h1>Why Do This?</h1>
		<p>You might be asking to yourself, why make a site about superheroes and supervillains? Well, simply put, it's the imagination that counts. Who wouldn't want to possess animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities and/or powerful regenerative abilities? I know i would!</p>
		<h1>What are Superheroes?</h1>
		<p>Superheroes consist of abnormal heroes who look identical to humans but have abilities that far exceeds common sense and tend to break the law of physics with their godlike power(s). They use their gifts to fight against criminals, supervillains, maintain peace and provide hope.</p>
		<h4 class="Reasontotable">Unfortunately, powers are truly a magnificent thing to have and aren't truly real in reality. It wasn't until June 1938 in which these powers had been bought onto the life of many young adults via comic books.</h4>
