		<h1>Why are comic book expensive?</h1>
		<p>	An event cited by many as marking the beginning of the Golden Age was the 1938 debut of Superman in Action Comics #1 which eventually over the years became popular specifically with the Hero type comic books. Comic books are expensive for collection purposes only. A few comic books that date back during 1940-1950 are worth a million times the amount of the price it went through during that period of time. During the 1940, Comic books were merely for the viewers eyes and imagination. There prices were range to be at 5 cents per issues</p>
