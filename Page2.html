			<h1>Villains</h1>
			<p>As one might expect, villains are criminals who provide despair to there surrounded. Kill without an issue and rampage throughout their cities. So what exactly makes a villain iconic? In comics, some villains are iconic in which they provide plot and plot twist to a hero's story. It changes their character flow and sometimes carry bad omen to their hero counterparts.</p>

		<h3>What are a few DC Universe iconic superheroes to mention here?</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><img id="TheJoker" src="/Users/admin/Desktop/HTML/Images/TheJoker.jpg"/>The Joker - Joker is Batman's archenemy who seeks to play around with Batman's life and his surrounding. Joker cares only about chaos, anarchy, and killing his victims in the funniest ways possible. Very little is known about this villain before he started dressing like a clown and tormenting the city. Maybe he was a failed comedian. Maybe he was a mob enforcer. That uncertainty has become part of Joker's charm. Unfortunately, the joker's origin is unknown even till today. This is not a villain we want to get close to or even understand. We just want to see him cut loose and make Gotham his playground. Maybe one day he'll make Batman see the joke that is life.</li>
			<li><img id="Brainiac" src="/Users/admin/Desktop/HTML/Images/Brainiac.jpg"/>Brainiac - Brainiac is unquestionably Superman's greatest foe. This cold, unfeeling android has devoted himself to amassing every last tidbit of knowledge there is. He catalogs the many cultures of the universe, collects samples, and destroys the rest so no one else can possess what he does. Often, Brainiac is portrayed as the destroyer of Krypton.</li>
			<li><img id="PoisonIvy" src="/Users/admin/Desktop/HTML/Images/PoisonIvy.jpeg"/> Poison Ivy - Some of the most beautiful plants in the world are dangerous. They’re alluring, beckoning you closer with their shape and their bloom, and by the time you realize the peril you’re in, it’s too late. In nature, beauty can be a weapon. So it’s fitting that Poison Ivy, Gotham’s beautiful-but-deadly eco-terrorist, would use it as hers.</li>
			<li><img id="Ras_Al_Ghul" src="/Users/admin/Desktop/HTML/Images/RasAlGhul.jpg"/>  Ra's al Ghul has kept himself alive for centuries by bathing in the mystical Lazarus Pits. He's used that long life to assemble a vast, worldwide empire and the clandestine organization called the League of Assassins. He believes that the best way to restore harmony to the world is to destroy most of humanity. But even Ra's can't live forever, and he's long had his eye on Batman as his heir and replacement. Ra's unique blend of antagonism and admiration towards Batman makes him one of the more compelling Bat-villains out there. </li>

			<h3>What are a few Marvel Universe iconic Villains?</h3>
			<h1>Marvel Villains</h1>

			<li> <img id="Venom" src="/Users/admin/Desktop/HTML/Images/Venom.jpg"/> Venom - Venom is an amplified version of his nemesis. When Eddie Brock stumbled across Spider-Man’s discarded alien costume, he inherited boosted versions of Peter Parker’s powers and the symbiote’s hatred for its former wearer. That quickly made Venom a force to be reckoned with, even among a rogues gallery as diverse and fearsome as Spider-Man’s. </li>
			<li><img id="DeathStroke" src="/Users/admin/Desktop/HTML/Images/DeathStroke.jpg"/>
			DeathStoke - DeathStroke earned his reputation as the best mercenary in the world several times over. His natural combat skills are enhanced by an experimental procedure that boosted his strength, reflexes, and brain power. Whether he battles the Teen Titans or the Justice League, Deathstroke is a one-man army that can give even heroes like Flash and Green Lantern pause. But beneath that armor, Deathstoke has an aura of tragedy that makes him compelling as a protagonist too. </li>
			<li ><img id="Magneto" src="/Users/admin/Desktop/HTML/Images/Magneto.jpg"/>
			Magneto - Magneto is unique in that he could also be towards the top of a list of the best superheroes. As the founder of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, he started out as a fanatic obsessed with making mutants the dominant race of the planet. But thanks to his lifelong bromance with Professor X, he was rehabilitated and joined the X-Men, fighting to make the idea of peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans a reality. But he finds himself atop this villains list because, just when he starts to take the higher path, Magneto stumbles. He often succumbs to his inner rage, born of being persecuted as a Jew during the Holocaust, and goes back to his evil ways.</li>
			<li><img id="Darkseid" src="/Users/admin/Desktop/HTML/Images/DarkSeid.jpeg"/> Darkseid - Darkseid is about as evil a figure as you'll find in the DCU. As one of the mythical New Gods of the Fourth World, he rules the hellish planet of Apokolips as an all-powerful tyrant. His 250,000-year rule has revolved around his quest to understand the elusive Anti-Life Equation. With it, Darkseid will make the entire universe abandon free will and submit to him. If any DC villain is ideally suited to appear in the eventual Justice League movie, it's Darkseid.</li>
			<li><img id="GreenGoblin" src="/Users/admin/Desktop/HTML/Images/GreenGoblin.jpg"/>Green Goblin - (SPOILER) Spiderman's greatest foe. Norman Osborn was driven insane by his exposure to the strength-boosting Oz formula. One Halloween costume, glider, and satchel-full of pumpkin bombs later, the Green Goblin was born. Osborn left his mark when he caused the death of Peter Parker’s love, Gwen Stacy. He’s since cheated death and even managed to elevate himself to an Avengers-class villain when he pretty much took over the world as the head of H.A.M.M.E.R.</li>

			<h1>You might be asking to yourself, who is my favourite villain/hero of all times?</h1>
			<p>Well, he's actually a really weird anti-hero who managed to make me laugh with his fourth wall breaking. He has 3 movies that he had appeared in and two standalone movies named after himself. He might be a villain and at times might even be considered to be a hero. He's Wolverine's best bud(Not really). He's goofy and all out a weirdo. He is Deadpool and boy does he talks alot.</p>
			<h1>Here's a video of Deadpool in his first Deadpool movie</h1>
